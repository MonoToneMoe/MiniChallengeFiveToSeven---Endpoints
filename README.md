Peer Review: 
For your MadLib Endpoint you need to have at least 10 inputs. You currently only have 2 inputs.
For both Reverse Endpoints you're using the Array.Reverse built in method. You're supposed to use a for loop to reverse the number and string.
Other than that Your Odd or Even Looks good!

Update(2:32PM) - Everything looks good! Changes has been made correctly keep up the good work! You story was very interesting...
